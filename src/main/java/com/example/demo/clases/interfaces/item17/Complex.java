//	Notice how the arithmetic operations create and return a new Complex instance rather than modifying this

//	a function to their operand, without modifying it. Contrast it to the procedural or imperative approach
//	in which methods apply a procedure to their operand, causing its state to change. Note that the method
//	names are prepositions (such as plus ) rather than verbs (such as add ). This emphasizes the fact that
//	methods donâ€™t change the values of the objects. The BigInteger and BigDecimal classes did not obey this
//	naming convention, and it led to many usage errors.
