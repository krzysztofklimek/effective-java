	// them to use wildcard types in client code. Properly used, wildcard types are nearly invisible to the users of

	// twice. The straightforward application is to the parameter list . It produces T instances, so we change the type
	// from List<T> to List<? extends T> . The tricky application is to the type parameter T . This is the first time
	// weâ€™ve seen a wildcard applied to a type parameter. Originally, T was specified to extend Comparable<T> , but a
	// comparable of T consumes T instances (and produces integers indicating order relations). Therefore, the
	// parameterized type Comparable<T> is replaced by the bounded wildcard type Comparable<? super T> . Comparables are
	// always consumers, so you should generally use Comparable<? super T> in preference to Comparable<T> . The same is
	// true of comparators; therefore, you should generally use Comparator<? super T> in preference to Comparator<T>.
